# Mental Health in the Workplace: A Data-Driven Analysis
# Overview
The Mental Health in the Workplace Project is a comprehensive analysis aimed at evaluating the provision of mental health benefits in workplaces, understanding the comfort level of employees discussing mental health issues, and identifying potential repercussions of such discussions in professional environments.

# Methodology
The project applied Python Pandas for data pre-processing, followed by a deep dive into the data using statistical analysis and hypothesis testing. Predictive analysis was conducted using logistic regression and random forest models. These models aimed to predict the likelihood of employers providing mental health benefits and their seriousness in addressing mental health concerns.

# Key Findings
The project showed robust predictive performance in identifying key factors impacting mental health support and awareness in the workplace. The results were promising in helping organizations identify areas of improvement in providing mental health support to employees.

Detailed findings and visualizations can be found in the project repository.

# Skills Developed
Throughout the project, the following skills were developed and refined:

Data manipulation: Pre-processing and structuring data effectively using Python Pandas.
Predictive analysis: Using logistic regression and random forest models for making predictions.
Interpretation: Drawing meaningful conclusions and understanding from the results of the analysis.
Communication: Effectively communicating complex findings to stakeholders.
